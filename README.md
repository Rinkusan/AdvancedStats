Rinku's Advanced Stats

Advanced Stats is an AddOn that keeps all of your important stats on your screen at all times.
I was a bit sick of using Macro's to fetch all of my Stats like Hit, Spellcrit, Bonus Healing and so on and so forth.
So now I started with tanking stats & also included a calculation of tankiness and threat values for Druids, based on Taladrils Gear List Stat Values, which he assures me are accurately calculated and tested.

Simply type /stats or change anything about your gear to start tracking :)

I have some plans on what may come next:
* Changing the displayed stats according to Class
* Changing the displayed stats according to Shapeshift Form
* Changing the displayed stats according to Specc
* Adding some kind of color code
* Adding caps/thresholds for specific stats
* Adding Resistances (courtesy of @Pippina :))
* Really Advanced: A menu with tickboxes to select stats you want to track.

But first of all, I need to make sure what is already there is accurate, there is some trouble with the Events that are being registered, as the Information often updates too quickly and ends up being wrong.

Anyway, anyone and everyone who is interested may contact me on Discord: Rinku#1352, Battle.net: Rinkusan#2164, Rinkusan on Barrens.chat or simply Ingame as Rinku or Fui on Gehennas (EU) Horde.
