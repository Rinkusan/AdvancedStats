Rinku's Advanced Stats

Advanced Stats is an AddOn for Classic World of WarCraft that keeps all of your important stats on your screen at all times.
I was a bit sick of using Macro's to fetch all of my Stats like Hit, Spellcrit, Bonus Healing and so on and so forth.
So now I started with Feral tanking stats & also included a calculation of tankiness and threat values for Druids, based on Taladrils Gear List Stat Values, which he assures me are accurately calculated and tested. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSVcmgixKaP9LC-rrqS4D2rojIz48KwKA8QBmJloX1h7f8BkUloVuiw19eR2U5WvVT4InYgnPunUo49/pubhtml#

Simply type /stats to start tracking :)

I have some plans on what may come next:
* Changing the displayed stats according to Class
* Changing the displayed stats according to Shapeshift Form
* Changing the displayed stats according to Specc
* Adding some kind of color code
* Adding caps/thresholds for specific stats
* Adding Resistances (courtesy of @Pippina :))
* Really Advanced: A menu with tickboxes to select stats you want to track.

Anyway, anyone and everyone who is interested may contact me on Discord: Rinku#1352, Battle.net: Rinkusan#2164, Rinkusan on Barrens.chat or simply Ingame as Rinku or Fui on Gehennas (EU) Horde.
